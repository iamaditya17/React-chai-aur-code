-----------------Browser Behind the scene----------------

Now a days browsers are more like an Operating System.

Browser consists of :
------------------------

1. Data & memory : store data, retrieve data etc...
2. UI : User interface through which user communicate with server
3. Browser Engine:
   i) Rendering Engine: render HTML, CSS and lit bit of JS
   ii) JS Engine
4. Network : load HTML file, load CSS file etc..
5. Timers : setTimeOut(),setInterval()

----------------How HTML Works------------------

HTML is a Document

Step-1: Browser will load the HTML files.
Step-2: Then it will convert the files into raw bytes(0,1).
Step-3: Then it will extract the character from the bytes and do the tokenization means it will detect the h1 tags, p tags etc..
Step-4: Then it will create the object of those tags
example: {
    tag: h1,
    title: name,
    data: Hi Aditya
}
Step-5: Then it will construct the model means which tags comes under which One (parent,siblings etc...)

Why HTML is called a DOM (Document Object Model)?
--------------------------------------------------
HTML is a document and then it will create the object of it's tags (step-4) and then it will create the model of the document (step-5)
