-----------------Browser Behind the scene----------------

Now a days browsers are more like an Operating System.

Browser consists of :
------------------------

1. Data & memory : store data, retrieve data etc...
2. UI : User interface through which user communicate with server
3. Browser Engine:
   i) Rendering Engine: render HTML, CSS and lit bit of JS
   ii) JS Engine
4. Network : load HTML file, load CSS file etc..
5. Timers : setTimeOut(),setInterval()

----------------How HTML Works------------------

HTML is a Document

Step-1: Browser will load the HTML files.
Step-2: Then it will convert the raw data into raw bytes(0,1).
Step-3: Then it will extract the character from the bytes and do the tokenization means it will detect the h1 tags, p tags etc..
Step-4: Then it will create the object of those tags
example: {
    tag: h1,
    title: name,
    data: Hi Aditya
}
Step-5: Then it will construct the model or Relations, means which tags comes under which One (parent,siblings etc...)
Step-6: DOM generation, then the realtions are converted into NodeList (dom tree), multiple NodeLists are there.

Why HTML is called a DOM (Document Object Model)?
--------------------------------------------------
HTML is a document and then it will create the object of it's tags (step-4) and then it will create the model or relation of tags of the document (step-5)

*Similarly the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) works.

How web page has been rendered in our browser?
-----------------------------------------------

When the bowser loaded the HTML file then it will start working on the DOM then when it see a reference link to CSS file in HTML file, then it will work simultaneously on CSSOM.

Both DOM & CSSOM are independent

Then Render Tree is generated

Render tree will first gathers all the information like DOM and CSSOM and give it to the Browser Engine

Then the Browser Engine will do some Mathematics calculations and then start the painting on screen.

Painting: When the webpage has been rendering on the browser it's called painting.

How JS works on browser?
-------------------------
When broswer finds the "script" tag in the html file then at that time itself it will stop generating the DOM,CSSOM and any otherworks it is doing.

First it will load the JS on to the browser and then it will resume it's works.

JS vs DOM --> DOM will be haulted until JS is loaded to the browser.
JS vs CSSOM --> JS will be haulted untill CSSOM is ready.

NOTE
----
We can execute the JS at last by using async.
